# Getting Started  
### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Things you will need:
* Install [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* Get api key from [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/api)

# Setup
Begin by running the following command in the root folder to install dependencies  
```
npm install
```  
Next, create a postgresql database  
```
psql
CREATE DATABASE <db_name>
```  
After your database is created and running, run the following commands to create database and add seed data  
```
npm run migrate:latest
npm run seed:data
```  
To start the server, run the following command  
```
npm start
```  
Next run the following commands to change directory to ```./frontend``` and install npm dependencies for react  
```
cd frontend
npm install
```  
Finally, to start the react app run the following command in ```./frontend```  
```
npm start
```  
# How to set up knexfile  
```knexfile.js``` can be find at the following path from the root folder: ```./backend/db```  

You will need to set up a ```.local.env``` file in the root folder which contains the following variables:  
```
API_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_api_acces_token>
API_CLIENT_ID=<your_api_client_id>
API_AUTH=Bearer <your_api_authentication>
DB_USER=<your_db_username>
DB_NAME=<your_db_name>
DB_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
NODE_ENV=development
```  
You will also want to add your ```.local.env``` to the ```.gitignore``` file in the root folder to avoid your sensitive data from being pushed to github üò±
